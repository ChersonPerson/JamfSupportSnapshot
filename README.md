## 🧭 Support Snapshot

Fast, structured Jamf Pro visibility for frontline IT & Support

Support Snapshot is a lightweight macOS app that pulls real-time Jamf Pro inventory into a single, readable snapshot for support engineers.
It removes the need to jump between Jamf pages, logs, and API calls while troubleshooting devices.

## 🚀 What it does today (Computers)

Support Snapshot currently supports macOS computers via Jamf Pro’s modern API:

| Capability | What you see |
|---|---|
| General | Name, Jamf ID, user, enrollment, MDM status, last check-in |
| Hardware | Model, serial, CPU, RAM, storage, battery |
| Security | SIP, Activation Lock, attestation |
| Applications | Installed app name, version, path |
| Configuration Profiles | Profile name, ID, install date |
| Certificates | Common name, expiration, status |

Everything is presented as a single “support-grade” snapshot instead of scattered Jamf pages.
